#wepy

wepy displays the weather in a terminal, and is inspired by https://github.com/schachmat/wego

The idea for this program, as well as the excellent ASCII art, and other sundry goodies, all
come from the wego project mentioned above.

##Features

* show forecast for 1 to 5 days
* nice ASCII art icons
* displayed info (metric or imperial units):
  * temperature
  * windspeed and direction
  * viewing distance
  * precipitation amount and probability
* ssl, so the NSA has a harder time learning where you live or plan to go
* config file for default location which can be overridden by command line

##Dependencies

* Tested under Python 2.7 and 3.4
* [Python requests](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests/2.5.3) - Python
  HTTP for humans
* utf-8 terminal with 256 colors
* A worldweatheronline.com API key (see Setup below)

##Setup

1. If you don't have the necessary API key, you can [register
   here](https://developer.worldweatheronline.com/auth/register) with your github.com account.
   Your github.com account needs a public email address, but
   you can choose a bogus one.
2. Copy your API key into the `conf.py` file, change the city to your preference, and
   choose if you want to use metric or imperial units. Save the file in the same folder
   with `we.py`
3. Run `python we.py ` to display the weather based on your conf entries, or
   override with command line arguments (run `python we.py --help` to see
   options)
